            Ta-Nehisi Coates originally set out to write a book about writing,
            in the tradition of Orwell’s classic “Politics and the English
            Language,” but found himself grappling with deeper questions about
            how our stories—our reporting and imaginative narratives and
            mythmaking—expose and distort our realities.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the first of the book’s three intertwining essays, Coates, on his
            first trip to Africa, finds himself in two places at once: in Dakar,
            a modern city in Senegal, and in a mythic kingdom in his mind. Then
            he takes readers along with him to Columbia, South Carolina, where
            he reports on his own book’s banning, but also explores the larger
            backlash to the nation’s recent reckoning with history and the
            deeply rooted American mythology so visible in that city—a capital
            of the Confederacy with statues of segregationists looming over its
            public squares. Finally, in the book’s longest section, Coates
            travels to Palestine, where he sees with devastating clarity how
            easily we are misled by nationalist narratives, and the tragedy that
            lies in the clash between the stories we tell and the reality of
            life on the ground.
